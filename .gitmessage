# ðŸ¤  Howdy!
# 
# This project abides by the Conventional Commit standard to determine the 
# correct semver bump and generate a CHANGELOG at release. We ask that at least
# the first commit in your PR follow the correct pattern ðŸ‘‡ below: 
#
#   ðŸ‘‰  [type](optional scope): [title of commit]
#       (e.g. `feat(button): secondary outline button variant`)
# 
#   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   type:   feat, fix, chore, bump (docs, style, refactor, perf, test)
#           (types in parens do not appear in CHANGELOG)
#   scope:  a noun describing any section of the codebase (e.g. button, config) 
#           surrounded by parenthesis
#   title:  brief description; 50 characters or less
#   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# ðŸ’¡ Including "BREAKING CHANGE:" in the commit message triggers a major release 
# in the example below. 
#
#   fix(scale): adjusts scale by 1 to start at 0px
#
#   BREAKING CHANGE: Scale shift affects all uses of scale in style props.
